# Prioritization Matrix — Denial Reduction Initiatives

The following initiatives are evaluated using an Impact vs Effort framework to ensure focus on high-value improvements.

| Initiative | Impact | Effort | Priority | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Eligibility Pre-Check | High | Low | High | Immediate reduction in preventable eligibility rejections |
| Coding Validation Rules | High | Medium | High | Significant reduction in coding-related denials |
| Weekly Denial Analytics Review | Medium | Low | Medium | Improves cross-team accountability with low effort |
| Automated Payer Feedback Integration | High | High | Low | High technical complexity; future enhancement |

## Priority Decision
 Enable **Eligibility Pre-Check** first — fastest ROI  
 Add **Coding Validation Rules** to reduce repeat errors  
 Establish **Weekly Denial Review** to sustain improvements  
 Keep **Automation** for later phase due to complexity
